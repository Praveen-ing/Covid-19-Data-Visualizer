📊 Data Sources
COVID-19 Data
Global and regional cases, deaths, and recoveries.

Daily, weekly, and monthly trends.

Population and demographic metrics.

Air Quality Data
AQI metrics: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc.

Data for Indian metropolitan cities (Delhi, Mumbai, etc.).

Temporal comparisons before, during, and after lockdowns.

📈 Visualizations
1. Global Analysis
Interactive world map showing pandemic spread.

Timeline of global infection rates.

Country-wise comparisons of key metrics.

Summary widgets for key statistics and trends.

2. India & Air Quality Analysis
City-wise dashboards for major Indian metropolitan areas.

Correlation charts for AQI vs. COVID-19 cases.

Comparative and temporal analysis across regions.

3. Advanced Analytics
Predictive modeling insights.

Statistical correlation analysis.

Identification of seasonal patterns.

⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations
Data is based on historical datasets and may not reflect real-time updates.

The application requires a modern browser with JavaScript enabled.

Performance may be impacted when rendering very large datasets.

Some charts depend on external libraries and require an internet connection to function correctly.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Integrate live data APIs for real-time updates.

Incorporate economic and healthcare indicators for a more holistic analysis.

Implement machine learning models for forecasting and prediction.

Expand coverage to include more cities and additional pollution metrics.
